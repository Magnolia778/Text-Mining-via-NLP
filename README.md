# Text Mining via NLP: A Data Science Approach towards Spam Text Classification for COVID-19.

**Text mining** (also referred to as text analytics) is a machine learning (ML) technology that uses **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) to transform the free (unstructured) text in documents and databases into 
normalized, structured data suitable for easy analysis. Text mining accomplishes this through the use of a 
variety of analysis methodologies; natural language processing (NLP) is one of them. 

Text mining uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), allowing machines to understand the human language and process it automatically.

The **COVID-19** pandemic has not only presented an unprecedented global health challenge but has also spurred an avalanche of information, much of it propagated through digital channels. In this digital age, where information spreads faster than ever before, the need to discern between credible and misleading content is paramount. Amidst this deluge of data, a critical concern arises: the proliferation of spam text messages related to **COVID-19**.

**Goal of text mining is: =**

• to transform the unstructured text into normalized, structured data. 

• to discover relevant information in text by normalize the data.

• transforming the text into data that can be used for further analysis. 

• to allowing machines to understand the human language and process it automatically.
